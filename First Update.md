So far for my soundscape, I have started to record most of my sounds. 

In this first round of edits, I started placing them in different spots

and started deciding the story I wanted to tell. 

I am going to make it more of a newsie piece, telling the story of a game,

using quotes and sounds to tell the story of what happened. 

In this clip, I'm using Jeff Capel and the sound of fans to portray a picture

of a victory over Louisville.
