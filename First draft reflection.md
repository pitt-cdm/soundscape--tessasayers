For my soundscape project, I am really excited just to make it. I am happy I can work with sports and things I am interested in and make something to tell a story of a basketball game.
I think it helps me when it comes to writing and reporting because if I can tell a story with sound, I can tell a story in words. 

I’m also excited because I like the idea I came up with for my project, kind of a looking back, highlight reel, rather than having the 
basketball noises and then the press conference. I think doing it the way I did will help the audience follow the story better. 

The most challenging part about it is making sure it flows well and sounds good. It is hard to make sure everything is 
working together the way I want it to. It’s also challenging to know if it will make sense to other people, who don’t know or follow basketball. 

Another challenge is overlapping sounds, especially four at once, and making sure it hits the time limit. I want to make sure 
it is done well and I don’t put in random sounds just to hit that time limit. 


Today I wanted to work on my project and get as much done of it as I could. Last night I I had 1:45, so I needed 15 seconds.
But after listening to it, I didn’t think it flowed well. 

So I changed the entire flow of it and where the quotes went. I knew it would be important for people to be able to follow it,
so I started with a quote so they knew Pitt won the basketball game. I then had the crowd cheering and a quote about the game. I then had a basket missing at the buzzer, with a sad noise from the crowd and a quote from the losing quote, Chris Mack. 

I then had the crowd cheering again and a quote from freshman Trey McGowens. I eneded with the quote I did from Coach Capel 
because I thought it summed up the game, and what people just listened to, well. 

I am proud of myself for really figuring out the flow of it and the background sounds. There were some parts, like the
beginning and ending, where I didn’t have any music. I knew it needed something and I chose Mac Miller because I thought it 
really went well and they play that song a lot at games. It was a taste of Pittsburgh. 

I am also proud of how much I used the sound tool and how much I overlapped sounds. A lot of my sounds have more than one
sound in them, so I had to get creative. I thought I used transitions and layered sounds well. 



What makes a soundscape work well:
using something people are familiar with 
Making sure people know the sounds that are being used
Having it follow a timeline almost
