Reflections 
1/24/19 

For my soundscape project, I am really excited just to make it. I am happy I can work with sports and things 
I am interested in and make something to tell a story of a basketball game. I think it helps me when it comes 
to writing and reporting because if I can tell a story with sound, I can tell a story in words. 
I’m also excited because I like the idea I came up with for my project, kind of a looking back, highlight reel, 
rather than having the basketball noises and then the press conference. I think doing it the way I did will help 
the audience follow the story better. 
The most challenging part about it is making sure it flows well and sounds good. 
It is hard to make sure everything is working together the way I want it to. It’s also challenging to know if 
it will make sense to other people, who don’t know or follow basketball. 
Another challenge is overlapping sounds, especially four at once, and making sure it hits the time limit. 
I want to make sure it is done well and I don’t put in random sounds just to hit that time limit.
