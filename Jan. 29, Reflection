After listening to my classmate’s soundscape projects and looking at the feedback I got, I went back into my soundscape and 
decided to make a couple changes. One piece of feedback I got was to make the basketball sounds more noticeable, so I 
tried to isolate some of those sounds and incorporate them more. 

I also wanted to look more into a foreground and background because one soundscape I listened to did that and I 
thought it worked really well. After thinking about it, I decided it would be best not to go with a constant background 
because my scenes and times change so much. Instead I decided to use music as kind of a focal point, with different 
sounds throughout my project. I try to use the quiet and louder music to help change focus and show a scene change, 
which I thought worked really well and was not something I am used to doing. 
I also worked on the ending of my soundscape, trying to make the sounds blend better and make sure the music wasn’t
too over powering. 

One comment I got was there was a lot of audio from the same person throughout. I agree there was, but I had the
best recordings from him and he had the most to say that fit in my piece and make it sound good. I didn’t want to use 
too much from the visiting coach because he mostly talked about his team and the player’s quotes were harder to hear 
and weren’t as good (college basketball players don’t really like press conferences.. shocking, I know). 

Overall I think I took a more abstract idea and made it work. While it is something that interests me, it was also a 
challenge to bring the game like atmosphere to a 3 minute clip.
