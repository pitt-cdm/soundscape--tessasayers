*Ballin Out* 

After Pitt won it's first ACC Men's Basketball in 690 days, did you wonder what it would have been like to be there? 
What the atmosphere was like and what first-year head coach Jeff Capel had to say? 

If you did, you're in luck. Becuase I was covering the game for The Pitt News, I was there and experienced it all first hand. 
I also have the sound to prove it. 

In a journalistic approach, *Ballin Out* tells you, through sound, exactly what that game was like. You get to hear from 
Pitt head coach Jeff Capel as well as Louisville head coach Chris Mack and Pitt freshman guard Trey McGowens who had an 
absurb 30 points in Pitt's win.

You also get the feel of what it is like to attend the game. In the MC and his infamous "Pittsburgh" along with the Oakland
Zoo's "oh oh oh ohhh oh." And giving you a feel by using songs that are frequently played at Pitt's Petersen Events Cetner. 

There was plenty of action in this game and I am hoping listening to this soundscape will not 
only make you feel as though you were there, but will also allow Pitt fans to relive the expereience for years to come.
